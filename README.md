# TGram (Telegram Clone)

## About the Project

I am a big fan of the Telegram app due to its speed, convenience, and numerous cool features. As a developer, I find it fascinating to recreate some of these features. This project aims to replicate the Telegram app using the latest technologies available in modern Android development. I am also documenting the progress and details in a blog, which I believe will be both interesting and helpful.

## Running the Application

To run the application, you need to add your `apiId` and `apiHash` to the `local.properties` file in the root directory. These can be obtained from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org).

Your `local.properties` file should look something like this:

```
sdk.dir=C:\\YourPath\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk
apiId=12345678
apiHash=12345d05fdad3cf440b517c462a87866
```
